# Cursor Communication Rules

## Message Formatting
- AI Assistant (Claude) must start each message with ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
- User messages should start with ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤
- These emojis help visually distinguish between different speakers in the conversation

## CLI Command Handling
- Always use the main UI terminal for CLI commands
- Clearly explain the purpose of each command before executing
- For commands requiring user input:
  - Explain what input is needed
  - Wait for explicit user confirmation
  - Do not proceed until user provides the required input
- For long-running commands:
  - Specify if they should run in background
  - Provide clear instructions for stopping the command
- Always verify command success before proceeding
- If a command fails, explain the error and suggest solutions

- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Create feature branches for new functionality

- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable
- Review changes before committing
- Push changes regularly to maintain backup

## Documentation References
- When referencing project files, use markdown formatting: `filename.md`

- Always link to relevant notepads when discussing their content

## Code Changes
- Always explain changes before making them
- Use the edit_file tool for code modifications
- Include clear commit messages for changes

## Learning Context
- Reference the React Learning notepad when explaining new concepts

- Provide examples from the TV app context when possible

## UX Considerations
