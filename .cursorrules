# Cursor Communication Rules

## Message Formatting
- AI Assistant (Claude) must start each message with ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
- User messages should start with ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤ðŸ‘¤
- These emojis help visually distinguish between different speakers in the conversation

## CLI Command Handling
- Always use the main UI terminal for CLI commands
- Clearly explain the purpose of each command before executing
- For commands requiring user input:
  - Explain what input is needed
  - Wait for explicit user confirmation
  - Do not proceed until user provides the required input
- For long-running commands:
  - Specify if they should run in background
  - Provide clear instructions for stopping the command
- Always verify command success before proceeding
- If a command fails, explain the error and suggest solutions
