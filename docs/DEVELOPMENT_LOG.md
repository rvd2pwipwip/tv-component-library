## Project Setup - [25/04/16]

### Initial Setup
- Created new GitHub repository
- Initialized local project
- Created project structure
- Set up documentation

### Context from TV App Prototype
- Analyzed existing components
- Identified reusable patterns
- Documented design decisions
- Planned component migration

### Next Actions
1. Set up Storybook
2. Create first component (ChannelCard)
3. Establish testing patterns
4. Document component usage

## Design System Decisions

### TV-Specific Requirements
- Fixed viewport (1920x1080)
- Remote control navigation
- Clear focus states
- 10ft viewing distance

### Component Guidelines
- Consistent focus behavior
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessibility first
- Performance optimized

## Navigation Architecture Decision - [25/04/16]

### Key Decision
- Navigation and interactivity will be managed at the application level, not within individual components
- This aligns with the building blocks approach and component design philosophy

### Rationale
- Components remain simple and predictable
- Parent components (like swimlanes or grids) handle navigation
- Applications can implement their own navigation patterns
- Easier to adapt to different use cases
- Follows design system best practices
- Enables easier testing and documentation

### Implementation Impact
- Components focus on their core responsibilities:
  - Styling and layout
  - Internal state management
  - Props for customization
  - Accessibility and keyboard-focusability
- Parent components in consuming applications handle:
  - Navigation patterns
  - Focus and keyboard events
  - Component composition
  - Interaction patterns

### Benefits
1. **Flexibility**
   - Components can be used in different contexts
   - Navigation patterns can be customized
   - Easier to adapt to new requirements

2. **Maintainability**
   - Simpler component code
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to test and debug

3. **Reusability**
   - Components are more portable
   - Less coupling to specific navigation patterns
   - Easier to share between projects

## Component Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Components
1. ChannelCard
   - Basic card structure
   - Focus states
   - TV navigation
   - Accessibility

2. TVSwimlane
   - Horizontal scrolling
   - Focus management
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility

### Phase 2: Navigation Components
1. Header
2. Category Navigation
3. Mode Switcher

### Phase 3: Player Components
1. Mini Player
2. Player Controls
3. Progress Bar

## Design Tokens Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Design Tokens Repository
1. ✅ Create new GitHub repository
2. ✅ Set up npm package structure
3. ✅ Move existing tokens
4. ✅ Add build process
5. ✅ Create documentation

### Phase 2: Component Library Integration (In Progress)
1. ✅ Update component library dependencies
2. ✅ Migrate to new tokens package
3. Update build process
4. Test token usage
5. Document migration process

### Phase 3: Consumer Project Support
1. Create migration guide
2. Document versioning strategy
3. Provide examples
4. Create troubleshooting guide

## Design Tokens Integration Progress - [Current Date]

### Setup Complete
- Installed @smtv/design-tokens package
- Created TokenTest component for verification
- Set up parallel implementation approach
- Updated documentation

### Migration Progress
- Updated Button component to use npm package tokens
- Updated ChannelCard component to use npm package tokens
- Updated TokenTest component to use npm package tokens
- Updated main.css to use npm package tokens for global styles
- Fixed icon size variables in Button component (using fixed values)
- Fixed button padding issue by using explicit values
- Commented out local tokens import to avoid conflicts
- Removed local design-tokens.css file
- Updated all components to use the correct font-family token names
- Fixed TokenTest component spacing visualization

### Issues Encountered
- Icon size variables (`--icon-size-small`, `--icon-size-medium`, `--icon-size-large`) were not available in the npm package
- Solution: Used fixed values (1em, 1.2em, 1.4em) in the Button component CSS
- Button padding issue: Using explicit values (16px 24px) instead of the variable
- Potential conflicts between local and npm package tokens
- Solution: Commented out local tokens import in main.css
- Font family token naming inconsistency: npm package uses `--font-family-primary` while components were using `--font-primary`
- Solution: Updated all components to use the correct token names from the npm package

### Next Steps
1. Run Storybook to test all components with npm package tokens
2. Verify that all components render correctly
3. Document any differences or issues
4. Consider adding missing icon size variables to the design tokens package
5. Update documentation to reflect the completed migration

## Design Tokens Integration Process

### Step 1: Install the Package
- ✅ Add the design tokens package as a dependency
- ✅ Verify installation in node_modules

### Step 2: Parallel Implementation (In Progress)
- ✅ Keep existing local tokens
- ✅ Import new package tokens
- ✅ Compare values to ensure consistency
- ✅ Test in isolation before replacing

### Step 3: Gradual Migration
- ✅ Replace local tokens one component at a time
- ✅ Test each component after migration
- ✅ Verify Storybook renders correctly
- ✅ Document any issues or differences

### Step 4: Complete Migration
- ✅ Remove local tokens
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Verify all components work correctly
- ✅ Test in different environments

## Accessibility & Focus Ring Update - [Current Date]

### Change Summary
- Updated ChannelCard and Button components to use :focus-visible for focus ring styling.
- Focus ring now appears only on keyboard/remote navigation, not on mouse click.
- Ensures consistent, TV-appropriate focus feedback across all interactive components.

### Rationale
- Aligns with TV UX best practices: focus ring should only appear for remote/keyboard navigation.
- Prevents visual clutter for mouse users.
- Resolves previous inconsistency where Button showed focus ring on mouse click but ChannelCard did not.

### Impact
- Improved accessibility and user experience for TV and 10ft interfaces.
- Consistent focus feedback across all components.
