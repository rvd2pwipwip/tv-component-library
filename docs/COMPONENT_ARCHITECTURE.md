# TV Component Library - Architecture Decisions

## Component Design Philosophy

### Building Blocks Approach
Components in this library are designed as simple, reusable building blocks. This approach:
- Keeps components focused and maintainable
- Allows for flexible composition in parent applications
- Follows design system best practices
- Enables easier testing and documentation

### Navigation and Interactivity
Navigation and interactivity are managed at the application level, not within individual components. This means:
- Components remain simple and predictable
- Parent components (like swimlanes or grids) handle navigation
- Applications can implement their own navigation patterns
- Easier to adapt to different use cases

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Responsibilities
Components should:
- Handle their own styling and layout
- Manage their internal state
- Provide clear props for customization
- Be accessible and keyboard-focusable
- Not implement complex navigation logic

### Parent Component Responsibilities
Parent components (in consuming applications) should:
- Implement navigation patterns
- Manage focus and keyboard events
- Handle component composition
- Define interaction patterns

## Example Usage

```typescript
// In the component library
export const ChannelCard = ({ title, thumbnailUrl, ...props }) => {
  // Simple card implementation
  return <div>...</div>;
};

// In the TV application
const Swimlane = () => {
  // Navigation logic here
  return (
    <div>
      <ChannelCard title="Channel 1" />
      <ChannelCard title="Channel 2" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**
   - Components can be used in different contexts
   - Navigation patterns can be customized
   - Easier to adapt to new requirements

2. **Maintainability**
   - Simpler component code
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to test and debug

3. **Reusability**
   - Components are more portable
   - Less coupling to specific navigation patterns
   - Easier to share between projects

## Considerations for Consuming Projects

When using these components:
1. Implement navigation at the appropriate level
2. Consider using a navigation library like Norigin Spatial Navigation
3. Test navigation patterns thoroughly
4. Document your navigation implementation
